Hi everyone!

I'm Alexis (or Allie for short!) and I'm currently learning full stack web development through the wonderful curriculum at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)! My dream is to one day be able to create beautiful web applications as a ruby on rails developer! I hope you have as much fun looking through the projects I've worked on as I had making them!

Thank you so much! 🥰

❤️ 🧡 💛 💚 🩵 💜 🩷 🤍

Here are some of the technologies that I'm currently learning!
